        <h2>Modelling a Street View</h2>
        <h3>Short Info</h3>
        <p>
          This project was made as the final project during high school. Since I
          was studying a creative programme the focus was to create something,
          rather than just write a paper.
        </p>
        <h3>How?</h3>
        <p>
          I focused on hard surface modelling in the 3D software called Blender.
          To make the final render more lifelike, I added a clay texture to all
          the objects, and chose colours that would imitate a colourful street
          like those that can be found in Stockholm or Copenhagen. I wanted the
          street to seem realistic, and to achive this I looked around the city
          where I lived, as well as pictures of other Scandinavian cities.
          Another important aspect was to make the city seem lived in, hence why
          there are signs, towels, flowers, boxes, lights, and even glass
          bottles outside the caf√©. All the windows on the buildings, and the
          glass bottles, has a procedural glass texture.
        </p>
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          I'm still proud of the final result, even after almost 3 years. I
          believe that the work I put in shows, and you can even see how I got
          more comfortable as time went on.
        </p>
        <h3>Software Used</h3>
        <p>The free 3D modelling software Blender.</p>
