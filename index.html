      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p class="square">
        My name is Julia Truedsson and I'm 21 years old. I'm born and raised in
        the city Karlskrona, which is located in the south of Sweden. Karlskrona
        is famous for its archipelago, which has led to me loving the sea.
      </p>
      <p class="square end-paragraph">
        During high school I studied game graphics, 3D, and animation. The main
        focus was on 3D modelling with hard surfaces, which I then showcased in
        my final project by modelling a city street view. I'm currently studying
        New Media Design, at Jönköping University.
      </p>
      <h3>Interest</h3>
      <p class="square">
        During my free time I like to spend time at home, by watching a series
        or playing games with my friends. I really enjoy travelling, and often
        do so when there is a concert I would like to attend.
